# Software-Testing-2
# White Box testing

## Overview
This repository contains my work for the university project where I explored various testing concepts and tools related to Java development. The main topics covered are:
- White Box Testing : This is a software testing technique that focuses on the internal logic, structure, and coding of an application.
- Test Cases: Writing effective test cases to validate the functionality of Java code.
- Control Flow Graph (CFG): Analyzing the control flow within the code to identify potential paths.
- Mutation Testing: Evaluating the robustness of test suites by introducing artificial defects.
- Test Path Coverage: Ensuring comprehensive coverage of different execution paths.
  
## Technologies Used
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Java: The programming language used for the assignment.
- JUnit: The testing framework for writing and executing test cases.
- JaCoCo: A code coverage tool to measure test coverage.
- draw.io for creating a CFG based on the code

## Report
- I have also written a detailed report based on these Project. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the Assignment, including the Control Flow Graph and Test Path Coverage. For more information, please refer to the report.
